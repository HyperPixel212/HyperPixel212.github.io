Pixel's quest is a game that im trying to learn how to make. Its an RPG game with my six main heroes. 
Blair,Crash,Sirus,Terra,Lumina and Pixel. Blair is a master of fire and alchemy hes usually the quiet one of the group
but he can be a great communicator when needs be. Crash is a nebulite which is a space race.
